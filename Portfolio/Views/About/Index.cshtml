    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section class="grid_7">
        <p>I'm a web application generalist. I've got a good bead on every level of the web development process, from database to visual design, but ask me to write an installable program, and I'm going to scratch my head. I didn't learn to program via a Computer Science degree, I learned it by experience and necessity and love. Which sounds vaguely superior, but is really just to say that my domain knowledge is a mile wide and an inch deep. Like I said, a generalist.</p>
        <p>I love web applications. It's wonderful to be able to take an idea from conception to finished, working product, and end up with something that looks good and behaves well. I have a particular crush on responsive, single-page applications that make heavy use of Javascript for seamless interaction.</p>
        <p>I helped to found a company in 2009. Although my partners and I eventually parted ways, it was an amazing experience that taught me bundles. I'm pretty good at grasping the big-picture reasons for doing things, and finding ways to execute them on my own. If there's one problem with that, it's that I haven't yet had the opportunity to work with a full product team. I'm excited to get to work hand-in-hand with other great designers and developers, rather than being a lone technology wolf.</p>
